# AttackBots

Attack Bots (working title) is a game project has provided interesting challenges and insights that relate to developing an RTS game within the Unity Game Engine. Planned features such as allowing characters to aim accurately towards targets using full-body kinematics has called for a closer look at how Inverse Kinematics Systems can be implemented in real time applications as well as how animation, physics, 3D Mathematics, and pathfinding can be coordinated to provide the requisite experiences.

**Current Features**

* Selectable Units that utilize pathfinding to avoid obstacles
* Units that can attack other units
* Last stand feature for downed units that utilize IK animations
